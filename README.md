# Support Forum Plugin

In a nutshell, this plugin allows a forum admin to configure one category as a "Support Forum". The category will then differ in one significant way: **Topics created by regular users can only be seen and accessed by replied to by the topic creator**

As normal, administrators have access to all topics created in the chosen forum. This allows a forum to become a private "support forum", where private information can be shared freely.

## Installation

Install via NodeBB Admin Panel, or `npm install nodebb-plugin-support-forum`
